# I_need_help
g++ (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0 || Easy C++ projects (Extension to VSC with Makefile)

So as name of my repository I NEED HELP. I strugled a little bit with SFML and Inheritance. Both of this things are new to me and I need to develop
a small game.
Problem starts at debuging I recive error that ,,conversion to inaccessible base class "Bazowa" is not allowed" and
"expr must have a class type, but have the type "Bazowa *"
and this shit is poping few times "no occurrence of an element overloaded "sf :: RenderWindow :: draw" does not match the argument list"

So yeah I would ask my teacher but he poorly answer to Emails and he doesn't have time for Us to check our code.

Ps. I also strugled with English a little bit.
